`Hey! I'm Ben Zarras, a Brooklyn-based software engineer with 10 years of experience
in startups and large tech companies. I am Co-Founder & CTO of [Connectome](https://connectome.care), an
early-stage startup building AI-enabled tools for autoimmune patients and their providers. 

Previously I was a Lead Software Engineer at [SeatGeek](https://seatgeek.com/), where I
worked on fraud prevention and AI pricing systems. Before that, I was an Engineering Manager at
Capital One, where I helped launch several new customer-facing mobile banking products. I enjoy building
and scaling products that have a positive real-world impact on customers.

I have an M.S. in Computer Science from [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) and a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering
from the [University of Rochester](https://rochester.edu/).
